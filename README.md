# ClydeConservation Assessment

Class: Object Oriented Programming
College: Glasgow Clyde College - Anniesland Campus
Course: HND Computing: Software Development

# Project Brief

Clyde Conservation is a small, but expanding conservation organization with links to Clyde University. It is a non-profit making
charitable organization which specialises in mammals, birds and reptiles.
As well as carrying out invaluable research with the animals at the organisation, they also provide sanctuary for animals
categorised as endangered animals. They provide educational support to schools and colleges and give lectures and talks to many
different organisations.
The current system is part manual and part computerised. It is very difficult to keep track of which Keeper is looking after which
cage â€“ some keepers are given too many cages to look after. Also, some of the animal details get lost or are not updated
correctly.

Clyde conservation would like you to design and implement a new computer system that will help them keep track of all the
animals in the organisation, and the allocation of both animals and keepers to each cage. The conservation has eight
Enclosures, each enclosure has a number of cages (details are shown in the table titled Additional Details â€“ Cage Information
and Danger Ratings).

NB: For the purpose of this assessment it is satisfactory to exclude keepersâ€™ details for the time being.

**In this project, I have opted not to include keepers as the lecturer made it clear that it is not a mandatory requirement for this assessment.**

ðŸ“‹ **Design Requirements**
```
â–ª Abstraction, encapsulation and information hiding used where appropriate
â–ª Inheritance and Polymorphism
â–ª All class-wide variables are private to prevent content coupling
â–ª Loose coupling by keeping to minimum class-wide variables, in other words, data coupling is used (parameters passing) in
preference to content or common coupling
â–ª Classes must be highly cohesive
```

ðŸ“‹ **Implementation Requirements**
```
â–ª The working solution must meet the given requirements using Object Oriented techniques.
â–ª Variables are correctly declared and initialised.
â–ª Arithmetic and/or logical operators are used correctly.
â–ª A range of control structures are implemented correctly.
â–ª At least two types of data structure are implemented correctly (e.g. Arrays, Linked Lists, Array Lists, â€¦.etc.) 
â–ª The program must contain a minimum of four classes, which contain attributes, methods including constructor methods,
setters and getters.
â–ª Objects are created from the derived classes, with possible initial attribute values set through the constructor methods
â–ª The program must contain at least one overloaded method (this may be a constructor method)
â–ª Parameters are passed correctly both within the class and between objects
â–ª Appropriate access types are defined for methods, attributes and classes
â–ª Use of pre-defined classes and/or methods from the standard object library (such as Math, Scanner, Validation, .. etc.)
â–ª The program must have the ability to handle errors appropriately using Exceptions and Exception handlers or pre-validation
â–ª The program code must be commented appropriately throughout.
